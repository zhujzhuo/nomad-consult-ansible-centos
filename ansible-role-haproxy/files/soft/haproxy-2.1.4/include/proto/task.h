/* Principle of the wait queue.
 *
 * We want to be able to tell whether an expiration date is before of after the
 * current time <now>. We KNOW that expiration dates are never too far apart,
 * because they are measured in ticks (milliseconds). We also know that almost
 * all dates will be in the future, and that a very small part of them will be
 * in the past, they are the ones which have expired since last time we checked
 * them. Using ticks, we know if a date is in the future or in the past, but we
 * cannot use that to store sorted information because that reference changes
 * all the time.
 *
 * We'll use the fact that the time wraps to sort timers. Timers above <now>
 * are in the future, timers below <now> are in the past. Here, "above" and
 * "below" are to be considered modulo 2^31.
 *
 * Timers are stored sorted in an ebtree. We use the new ability for ebtrees to
 * lookup values starting from X to only expire tasks between <now> - 2^31 and
 * <now>. If the end of the tree is reached while walking over it, we simply
 * loop back to the beginning. That way, we have no problem keeping sorted
 * wrapping timers in a tree, between (now - 24 days) and (now + 24 days). The
 * keys in the tree always reflect their real position, none can be infinite.
 * This reduces the number of checks to be performed.
 *
 * Another nice optimisation is to allow a timer to stay at an old place in the
 * queue as long as it's not further than the real expiration date. That way,
 * we use the tree as a place holder for a minorant of the real expiration
 * date. Since we have a very low chance of hitting a timeout anyway, we can
 * bounce the nodes to their right place when we scan the tree if we encounter
 * a misplaced node once in a while. This even allows us not to remove the
 * infinite timers from the wait queue.
 *
 * So, to summarize, we have :
 *   - node->key always defines current position in the wait queue
 *   - timer is the real expiration date (possibly infinite)
 *   - node->key is always before or equal to timer
 *
 * The run queue works similarly to the wait queue except that the current date
 * is replaced by an insertion counter which can also wrap without any problem.
